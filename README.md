# Codementor AI Project

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/1f409916-a93b-4fbf-9ab7-c5e1fb83fdb6
## Overview

This project leverages [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev), an AI-powered full-stack development platform, to rapidly prototype and deploy web applications. By utilizing natural language prompts, Lovable.dev enables the creation of responsive front-end applications integrated with backend services like Supabase.([redsider.com][1], [Banani][2])

## Features

* **AI-Driven Development**: Generate web applications using natural language descriptions (power by openai).
* **Frontend**: Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast and efficient development.
* **Styling**: Utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling.
* **Backend Integration**: Integrated with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for backend services, including authentication and database management.
* **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and improved developer experience.
* **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly sync your projects with GitHub for version control.([Banani][2], [redsider.com][1])

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
